    > Code walkthrough
    > attributes get called itself, methods are called manually
3. Why Python is called OOP? - everything in Python is an object (data structure, data type etc)
4. Advantages of OOPS:
    > You can create your own datatype
    > code reusability
    > debugging
    > easy to colab
